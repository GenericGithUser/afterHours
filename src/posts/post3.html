<h2>December 2025 Blog</h2>
<br>
<p>Wow, the actual start of this blog thingy, i suppose its also fitting that it starts at the tail end of the year as it can be seen as a literal mark of a new beginning. I hope that I can continue most of these every month starting from now as I would like to do long form updates to exercise my writing and typing skills, so December 2025.</p>

<p>It is a very busy busy month, for a month that is supposed to be centered around the "yuletide" season, for me at least, I don't feel it as much, as a lot school works were just given this month or were done this month. It is interesting, as the faculty probably thought to themselves <blockquote>"hmmm, Christmas break is just around the corner, lets dump everything on them."</blockquote> I guess they just do not want us to properly celebrate the season in preparation for the real world workplace, It is what it is I guess.</p>
<br>
<p>For the school works that were done this month, well to be honest, those were supposed to be started last month but my groupmates work like how the tectonic plates work, they move like 2 inches per year, thus leading to a lot of cramming, and by school works, this is just one, a film for our RVA Subject, that led us to have our thrid week of December just filled with a lot of filming, now there's a problem with sorting and editing, as people are starting to get harder to contact, hopefully by next year we could actually have some progress again on it, the deadline is also in the 2nd week of January, pretty much right after the Christmas break. Hoping for the best for our group. For other school works, our PathFit finally had some movement, as we had our first face-to-face meeting with actual teaching this month, and that led into a whole lot of cramming and stuff for us, and now we also have to cram a video project our teacher wants us to do, which I cannot do as I need a partner, and my chosen partner is currently in Romblon getting wasted, hopefully we can do it like the day before submmisions or something.</p>

<p>School stuff aside, let's go back to the yuletide season celebrations stuff, for starters, we did not have a Christmas party this year, as our officers also work like tectonic plates, and proposed to have a Christmas party, in our final week of classes before the break, and they want it online, so... of course, nobody wanted to participate, which is to be expected, a lot of my classmates are pretty much gunning to go to their respective provinces at the same week, and doing an online Christmas party is just absurd, so nothing came of with it. But I kinda did get to participate in a Christmas party, twice actually. With the first being me and a lady friend being randomly included in one of my friend's Christmas Party, or at least the tail end of it, we got free drinks though, and did a lot of catching up after the party as we try to find a place to stay after that as it is already very late at night and most of the places to loiter around is already closed, it was fun though, then the second one was much more fun, although a little bit more scuffed, it was my main circle of friends Christmas party, or it was probably just a get together or something Idk, but I was really happy to see it come to fruition, as after Senior High, our schedules were starting to be hard to match, so this was a very rare occurance, it was very fun and we had a lot of time catching up, though I think it is not enough, as we started too late and didn't realize that the place we're at UP Diliman, has a curfew, so we were shooed away after 10. Was kinda banking on it going up until 12AM or later as I want to spend more time with them, but I guess there is a quota for how long I can get to see them and catch up, and I already used up my remaining time.</p>

<p>Those two events were pretty much my Christmas celebration, as the actual event itself, which I am writting right now is pretty uneventful and eerily quiet, like I supposed I'm not used to it, even though last year were kinda quite the same, except I guess this would be the first Christmas we would celebrate without my mother, last year, there were 3 of us celebrating Christmas eve, and last night, there were only two of us, me and my sister, as in both years, my father is not present as he is stuck working a night shift.</p>
<br>
<p>I guess I really am not just used to it, and I really should already be, my mother pretty much sets what happens during Christmas time, and we would get a lot of visitors, and we would have a lot of dishes and stuff for the celebration, but as time goes by, and my mother also leaving, Christmas hasn't really been the same. We were supposed to go have Christmas in my father side's family like our aunts and cousins, but all of them have their own agendas, so here we are. I guess this is training for real life as well I guess, the final years of me being a student would be in preparation to be much more bland, as we are starting to not really preparing for such events. Even doing things that we used to do during Christmas eve like watching TV together doesn't have the same effect anymore. I guess that is part of growing up, Christmas is somewhat for kids anyways, as they pretty much the main benificiaries of the occasion or probably Im just too negative that it is making me say those things. Oh well, hopefully next Christmas would be more celebratory, I think we are still, as a family at least still coping from my mother's lost that we couldn't celebrate properly. I kinda miss doing the early preparations for it, and also doing random stuff to my phone which I sadly can't do
anymore, oh well.</p>
<br>
<p>I guess, Merry Christmas dear reader, I hope you are not in the same boat as me and actually be happy this season. Hope you receive many gifts and actually have a proper celebration with your family</p>
<br>
<p>I Will probably make a 2025: Year In Review at like the 30th so that I could include stuff that could occur after writing this</p>
<h3>Au revoir for now Dear Reader</h3>
